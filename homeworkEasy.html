    <p>1. Review the slides. Check out the code examples.<br>
       2. Review processing.org's reference page.<br>
       3. Look for code examples online (EX : try googling "Java if statement")<br>
       4. If you're still stuck, email me with the problem you're having :)<br>
       5. Use the reference page on this website.

  <p><b>These problems shouldnt be too hard</b></p>
  <p>1. Create an int variable called x. Set x equal to 100.</p>
  <p>2. Create an int variable called y. y should equal 200.</p>
  <p>3. Print x plus y.</p>
  <p>4. Write a program that prints 100 times 50 minus 5.</p>
  <p>5. Write a program that prints "Programming is the best."</p>


  <br>
  <p><b>These problems are a little bit harder, but you should still be ok doing them</b></p>
  <p>1. Write code that prints "Hello world!" only if x is greater than 0</p>
  <p>2. Write code that checks if age is greater than 10. If true, print "Hi!"<br>
            If not, print "Goodbye!"</p>
  <p>3. Write code that checks if the variable passcode is equal to 100. If it is,<br>
            print passcode. Otherwise, print "Go away."</p>
  <p>4. Create a variable x that equals 29183 and a variable y that equals 1956.<br>
            Write code that multiplies x times y and prints the result.</p>
