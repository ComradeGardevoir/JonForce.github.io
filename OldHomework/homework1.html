  <h1>Homework</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class. I will be posting the<br/>
    solutions by wednesday.</p>

    <p>If you get stuck, please do these things (in this order) :</p>
    <p>1. Review the slides. Check out the code examples.<br>
       2. Review processing.org's reference page.<br>
       3. Look for code examples online (EX : try googling "Java if statement")<br>
       4. If you're still stuck, email me with the problem you're having :)
     <br><b>If you email me, include your name and what class you're in please.</b></p>

       <p>Everyone should do the easy problems and the medium problems.
         <br>If you can't solve the hard problems, that's ok. I don't expect that
         many of you<br> are able to solve them.</p>

      <p>If you are able to solve the really hard problems, send me your solution!
        <br>I will be so proud and it would be cool to see how you did it :)</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>These problems should be on the easier side.</b></p>
  <p>1. Write code that prints "Hello world!" only if x is greater than 0</p>
  <p>2. Write code that checks if age is greater than 10. If true, print "Hi!"<br>
            If not, print "Goodbye!"</p>
  <p>3. Write code that checks if the variable passcode is equal to 100. If it is,<br>
            print passcode. Otherwise, print "Go away."</p>
  <p>4. Create a variable x that equals 29183 and a variable y that equals 1956.<br>
            Write code that multiplies x times y and prints the result.</p>


  <br>
  <p><b>These problems are a little bit harder, but you should still be ok doing them</b></p>
  <p>1. Write a program that draws circles at the mouse's position. But only when<br>
          the user is pressing a button</p>
  <p>2. Write a program that prints every number between 1 and 9999.<p>
  <p>5. Write a function called "printTwice()" that prints the string that you give it
      <br>twice. You should be able to use it like this :
      <br>printTwice("Hello");
      <br>And it should print
      <br>HelloHello</p>
  <p>6. Write a function that draws a blue circle on the screen. It should be called
      <br>drawBlueCircle(). The function should work if you use it like this :
      <br>drawBlueCircle()</p>
  <p>7. Write a program that draws circles at the mouse position. Now make it so
    <br>that the color of the circle changes over time. This one is hard,
    <br>it will require some creative problem solving.</p>


  <br>
  <p><b>These problems are hard. If you can do these then you're doing great.
            (Solving these may require googling!)</b></p>
  <p>1. Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 0 and 9999</p>
  <p>2. Write a program where you can draw circles on the screen at the mouse position.
    <br>Next, make it so that the color of the circles can be changed by pressing a button.</p>
  <p>3. Write a program where there is a circle in the center of the screen. Make it so
    that you can move<br>it by pressing W, A, S, D. W should move the circle up,
    D should move the circle right. S should move the circle down.<br>
    And A should move the circle right.</p>

<br>
<p><b>BONUS : </b></p>
<p>If you can, you should make try to make a simple game and bring it into next
  <br>class. I haven't taught you how to make games yet but everyone in the class
  <br>has everything they need to start making a game! If you bring in a game you
  <br>will get cookies and I will show your game to the class.</p>
