  <h1>Homework 2</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class. I will be posting the<br/>
    solutions after next class.</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Problem set A</b></p>
  <p>1. Create a function that returns an array with the following values :<br>
    "Moose", "Snake", "Awesome"</p>
  <p>2. Create a function that takes 1 integer parameter, x. The function should
    return an array with the all of the even numbers leading up to x.<br>
    The function should work like this :
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      int[] array = evenArrayFunction(10);
    </pre>
    <br>Array should look like this :<br>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>3. Write a function that takes in an array of integers as a parameter.
        The function should print out everything in the array.<br>
        You should be able to use the function like this :<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          int[] arrayToPrint = new int[] { 1, 3, 3, 7 };
          printArray(arrayToPrint);
        </pre>
        <br>It should print out :<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          1 3 3 7
        </pre>
      </p>

    <p>4. Write a function that takes in an array as a parameter.<br>
          The function should multiply every element in the array times 2.<br>
          You should be able to use the function like this :<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            int[] arrray = new int[] { 1, 3, 3, 7 };
            multiplyArray(array);
          </pre>
          And then afterwards, all of the elements should be :<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            2 6 6 14
          </pre>
        </p>

  <p><b>Problem Set B</b></p>

    <p>We're going to be working on a simple game for Problem Set B.
      <br>We'll be making a game where we have to use the A and D keys to
          dodge rain. This will test your ability to solve problems creatively<br>
          and combine ideas we talked about in class.
        <br> You may not be able to get through all this, but try to get as
            far as you can. Reach out for help if you need it.</p>

    <p>1. The first step is to copy the starting code from the reference page
      into processng. Our game will be starting off as the rain program.</p>

    <p>2. The next step is modifying the rain program so that it rains much
      less. Currently the program rains a lot. Make less rain spawn.<br>
      You're probably going to want to slow down the fall of the raindrop too.</p>

    <p>3. Next we need to add in our character at the bottom. For now our character<br>
      will be a green circle. The idea is that the green circle has to dodge the blue<br>
      circles that are falling.<br>
      Add in a green circle on the bottom of the screen that can be controlled by<br>
      the keys A and D.</p>

      <p>4. The next step is that we need to be able to detect when a raindrop hits
        <br> our character. We can do that by checking the distance between the raindrops
        <br> and the character. If the distance between any raindrop and the character
        <br> is less than 10, the game is over and the player lost.</p>
      <p>In order to check the distance between two points, you can use the following
        function :<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html
        </pre>
        <br>
        The idea is that when we detect a <b>collision</b> between the raindrop
        and the player, we have to trigger that the game is now over.<br>

        We can do that by having a boolean variable called gameOver.<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          boolean gameOver = false;
        </pre>
        <br> The variable should be created at the top of the program (so that
        it can be used everywhere.)<br>
        It should start off as false because when the game starts, the game is not over.<br>
        But when we detect the rain hit the character, we need to set it to be true.<br>
        <br>Here's how :
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          gameOver = true;
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>5. When the gameOver is true, we want to stop the game.<br>
        We can do this by checking if gameOver == false in the draw function.<br>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
          if (gameOver == true) {
            // Do stuff that should happen when the game is over.
          } else {
            // Do stuff that should happen when the game is still going.
          }
        </pre>
        <br>Start of by printing "Game is over!" when the game has ended.
      </p>

      <p>6. Next, we should make it so that instead of printing "Game is over!"
          when the game<br>has ended it should draw "Game over" text on the screen.<br>
          It's easy to draw text in processing. As an exercise, try figuring out<br>
          how to do it by using google as an exercise :)</p>


      <p>7. Our game should probably have a score system so that the longer you
        <br>avoid the raindrops, the more points you get.<br>
        We can accomplish this by creating a float variable called "score" at
        the top of the program. Every draw that we don't get hit by a raindrop,<br>
        increase score by some small amount (maybe 0.001 ?). When the game is<br>
        over, draw the score on the screen too next to the game over text :)</p>


      <p>8. If you've made it this far, you're doing great. Try to get creative<br>
        and add more things to the game. Here's some ideas :<br>
        - Make the game get harder as it progresses.<br>
        - Use images instead of circles.<br>
        - Add powerups.<br>
      </p>
