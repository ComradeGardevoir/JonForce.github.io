  <h1>Homework 2, Year 2</h1>

  <p><b>Have these done by next class</b></p>

  <p><b>Basic Problems</b></p>
  <p>Use google if you need help!</p>

  <p>1.) What is breadth first search?</p>
  <p>2.) What is depth first search?</p>
  <p>3.) Why can't depth first graph search be used to write a good chess AI?</p>
  <p>4.) If we were to use a search algorithm for a tree of states with no loops,
    what search algorithm would be best? Why?</p>
  <p>5.) What's the difference between tree search and graph search?</p>

  <p><b>Implementation Problems</b></p>

  <p>1.) Write a class called Node that has the following members :
      <br>- a Node variable called 'next'
      <br>- a boolean variable called 'goal' (defaults to false)
  <p>2.) Create 4 nodes objects, a, b, c, and d.</p>
  <p>3.) Set :
      <br>a.next = b
      <br>b.next = c
      <br>c.next = d
  <p>4.) Set d.goal = true
  <p>5.) Create a function called depthFirstSearch(...) that takes in
          a Node start as a parameter and searches for the goal node.
          <br> It should print out each node as it searches and return true
          <br> when it finds a solution.
