  <h1>Homework 10</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class.</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p><b>HashMap Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Create a hashmap that uses Strings for keys and stores Integers.</p>
  <p>2. Add the following key / value pairs to the hashmap :
    <br>("Roadhog", 600)
    <br>("Tracer", 150)
    <br>("Mercy", 200)</p>
  <p>3. Write a loop that prints out all of the keys in the map.</p>
  <p>4. Write a loop that prints out all of the values in the map.</p>
  <p>If you have trouble with these, remember to go check out the slides.</p>

  <br>
  <p><b>Ternary Operator Practice</b></p>
  <p>Use the ternary operator to solve all these problems :) </p>

  <p>1. Create an integer x that is equal to a random number between 0 and 100.</p>
  <p>2. Create a String s that is equal to "HanzoPleaseSwitch" if x is less than 50,<br>
        and equal to "Kaplan" otherwise.</p>
  <p>3. Print out the number 10 if x is less than 5, otherwise print 66.</p>
  <p>4. Create a float z that is equal to 100 if x is equal to 10. z is 50 otherwise.</p>

  <br>
  <p><b>[Hard] Recursive Problems</b></p>
  <p>Please try these. I know that they're hard, recursion is hard.<br>
  Think about what the base case is, and what the recursive case is.</p>

  <p>1. Write a recursive function that takes in an int x. It should print<br>
    all the numbers from x down to 0. We did this in class so this should be easy.</p>
  <p>2. Write a recusive function called "evenness" that prints out how even a number is.<br>
    A number's evenness is determined by how many times it can be divided by 2.<br>
    EX : 2 has an evenness of 1<br>
        4 has an evenness of 2<br>
        8 has an evenness of 3<br>
        10 has an evenness of 4<br>
      </p>
  <p>3. Write a recursive function that returns the sum of all numbers between 0 and n.<br>
    n is the integer input that is given to the function. We did this in class.</p>
