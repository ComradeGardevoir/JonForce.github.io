  <p><b>Final Problem</b></p>

  <p>This is the most important part of the homework assignment. I gave you less<br>
    homework so that you would have time to do this. The assignment is to use all<br>
    of the information you've learned so far in class and make a game. It doesn't have<br>
    to be a big game, but your game should have a score, you should be able to lose.</p>
  <p>I expect all of you to email me the code for your game.</p>
