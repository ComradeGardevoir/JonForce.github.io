  <h1>Homework 4</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class.</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p><b>Basic Review Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Create an integer, x that is a random number between 2 and 10.</p>
  <p>2. Create a second integer, y that is a random number between 11 and 50</p>
  <p>3. Write a program that prints all of the numbers between x and y.</p>
  <p>4. Write a program that adds all of the numbers between 0 and 100.
      (Including the number 100). It should print the result.</p>
  <p>5. Write a program that draws a background color of blue if the mouse in
    on the lower half of the screen, and a background color of red if the<br>
    mouse is on the upper half of the screen.</p>


  <br>
  <p><b>Array List Review Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Create an ArrayList that stores Strings. Add the Strings "Moose", "Awesome", "Snake"<br>
    to the list.</p>
  <p>2. Create an ArrayList that can store Integers. Next, add all of the numbers<br>
    between 0 and x to the ArrayList (where x is a random number between 10 and 50).</p>
    <p>3. Next, write a program that prints all of the numbers in the list you just created.</p>
  <p>4. Create an ArrayList that stores Inegers. Add all of the integers between 0 and
    50 to the list.<br> Next, remove all of the integers between 10 and 20 from the list.<br>
    Finally, write code that prints the list.</p>
  <p>5. Create a class called Color. Color should have a R, G, and B integer values.<br>
      Next, create an ArrayList that stores Colors and add 10 random Colors to it.</p>
  <p>6. [This one is hard] Given the ArrayList of random colors in the last problem,<br>
      how can we select a random color out of the list (and use it as our background color)?</p>


  <br>
  <p><b>Timining Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Write a program that prints out, "Tracer" every one second.</p>
  <p>2. [This one is hard] Write a program that changes to a random background color<br>
    every 2 seconds</p>
  <p>3. [This one is hard] Print "Hi" every draw() for one second, then "Bye" every draw() for one second<br>
    then reset.</p>

  <p><b>Class Review Problems</b></p>
  <p>1. Create a class called Circle. Circles have the following properties :<br>
      Three integers, r, g, and b, that represent their color.<br>
      Two floats, x, and y, that represent their position.</p>
  <p>2. Create a constructor in the class. When the constructor is called, it should<br>
    set the x, y, r, g, and b to all be random values.</p>
  <p>3. Create an ArrayList that can store Circles.</p>
  <p>4. In the setup function, create one Circle and put it into the list.</p>
  <p>5. In the draw function, write a loop that draws all of the circles in the list
    to the screen. Remember to use the Circles' fill colors.</p>
  <p>6. [This part is hard] Write code so that every 1 second, it adds another Circle
    to the list.</p>
