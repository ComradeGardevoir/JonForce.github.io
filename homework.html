  <h1>Homework 5</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class.</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p><b>General Review Problems</b></p>

  <p>1. Create an ArrayList that can store integers.</p>
  <p>2. Fill the ArrayList with 100 random numbers.</p>
  <p>3. Print out all the numbers in the list.</p>
  <p>4. Write a program that prints "Harambe" every 1 second.</p>
  <p>5. How can we write a for loop that prints all the numbers between 10 and 100?</p>
  <p>6. [Hard] Write a program that has prints out "Dark Voyager" exactly 50% of the time.</p>
  <p>7. [Hard] Write a program that adds together all the numbers between 0 and 100. Print the result.</p>
  <p>8. Create an array of 50 strings. Set the last element in the array to be "Hello".</p>
  <p>9. How do we get the size of an array?</p>
  <p>10. How do we get the size of an ArrayList?</p>

  <br>
  <p><b>Multidimensional Problems</b></p>

  <br> These are hard. Good luck.
  <br>

  <p>1. Create a 2D array of integers that is 5 by 5.</p>
  <p>2. In the array, set the second element in the second array to be 135.</p>
  <p>3. Create a 2D array of integers that is 50 by 50.</p>
  <p>4. Write a 2D loop that sets all of the integers in the array to be random.</p>
  <p>5. [Very Hard] Write a multidimensional loop that outputs the following pattern :<br>
      0<br>
      1<br>
      2<br>
      0<br>
      2<br>
      4<br>
      0<br>
      3<br>
      6<br>
      0<br>
      4<br>
      8<br>
      0<br>
      5<br>
      10</p>
  <p>6. Create a 5 dimensional array of Strings.</p>
  <p>7. [Hard] Create a String array of size 50. Set every element in the array to be<br>
        i number of the letter 'a'.<br>
        Ex : array[0] should = ''<br>
        array[1] should = 'a'<br>
        array[2] should = 'aa'<br>
        array[3] should = 'aaa'</p>

  <br>

  <p><b>Final Problem</b></p>

  <p>You must work on a game. You need to develop a small game on
  <br>your own. This will give you practical experience that programming problems won't.
  <br>I'm very sure that all of you have the skills to make a simple game. Even if you<br>
  fail at making a game, just trying will give you a ton of practice that will help you be a better programmer.</p>
