  <h1>Homework 1, Year 2</h1>

  <p>Please complete this homework before next class. I will be posting the<br/>
    solutions after next class.</p>
  <br>

  <p><b>Problem set A</b></p>

  <p>1. Write a function called "printTwice()" that prints the string that you give it
      <br>twice. You should be able to use it like this :
      <br>printTwice("Hello");
      <br>And it should print
      <br>HelloHello</p>
  <p>2. Write a program that draws circles at the mouse position. Now make it so
    <br>that the color of the circle changes over time. This one is hard,
    <br>it will require some creative problem solving.</p>
  <p>3. Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 0 and 9999</p>
  <p>4. Write a program where there is a circle in the center of the screen. Make it so
    that you can move<br>it by pressing W, A, S, D. W should move the circle up,
    D should move the circle right. S should move the circle down.<br>
    And A should move the circle right.</p>


  <p><b>Problem set B</b></p>

    <p>1. Create a class called "Position" that has two members, an integer x and an integer y.</p>
    <p>2. Create an array of 50 Positions. Use a loop to fill them with random positions.</p>
    <p>3. In the draw function, use a loop to draw circles at the 50 positions.</p>

  <p><b>Problem set C</b></p>
    <p>1. Create an ArrayList that can store integers.</p>
    <p>2. Fill the ArrayList with 100 random numbers.</p>
    <p>3. Print out all the numbers in the list.</p>

  <p><b>Problem set D</b></p>
    <p>1. Create a 2D array of integers that is 5 by 5.</p>
    <p>2. In the array, set the second element in the second array to be 135.</p>
    <p>3. Create a 2D array of integers that is 50 by 50.</p>
    <p>4. Write a 2D loop that sets all of the integers in the array to be random.</p>
